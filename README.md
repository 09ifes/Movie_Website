# Movie_Website
This is a website that displays movies from the sakilla database, and allows various CRUD interactions such as viewing, adding/editing, deleting films. Films can also be filtered by genres and name, and can be partioned into sections such as 'most recent', 'most popular' and 'similar films'.

Developed using Java, React.js, Spring Boot, MySQL, HTML and CSS. Tests were written using JUnit for backend unit tests, Cucumber for testing the database, and Cypress for testing the frontend.

The backend files can be downloaded and opened in Intelliji, however it will require the installation and setup of Maven on the computer. This is a guide for installing and setting up on windows 10: https://devwithus.com/install-maven-windows/#:~:text=How%20to%20Install%20Maven%20on%20Windows%2010%201,...%207%20Common%20Issues%20...%208%20Conclusion%20

With everything set up and complete, the backend localhost server can be run by executing the command: mvn spring-boot:run, in the terminal, or by simply running the demoApplication java file. For setting up and running the frontend, please check to README in the Movie_Website_Frontend directory.
