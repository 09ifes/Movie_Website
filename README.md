# Movie_Website
This is a website that displays movies from the sakilla database, and allows various CRUD interactions such as viewing, adding/editing, deleting films. Films can also be filtered by genres and name, and can be partioned into sections such as 'most recent', 'most popular' and 'similar films'.

Developed from scratch using Java, React.js, Spring Boot, MySQL, HTML and CSS. Tests were written using JUnit for backend unit tests, Cucumber for testing the database, and Cypress for testing the frontend.
